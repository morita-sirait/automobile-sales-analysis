# Using Python 
In  jupyter notebook using the python programming language, the following are the results of data analysis from automobile sales data. 
First we must import pandas library as pd. the pandas libarary use to anlysis and data manipulation

we can also see outliers as very different price in certain categories. 

from the following bar plot grafik, we can determine what countries order the most. 




# Using SQL 
Data processing using the Python programming language shown below was carried out using APEX software from Oracle. 
the following is the syntax to view all columns of a table. there are 20 columns in automobile data. 

this is the syntax for displaying the structure of a table. 
here we can see data type of column, length of data type, primary key, etc. 

we can see the total sales of automobile 

from the following syntax we know that the first day of automobile ordering is 6 January 2018 and the last day of automobile ordering is 31 May 2020. 

we can see that best month sales is November 2019 

and the top selling product is classic cars category
